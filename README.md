## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone or Download**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Serve with a Local Server**:
   - Install and run [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server):
     ```bash
     npm install -g live-server
     live-server
     ```

3. **Access**:  
   Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.

> **Note**: A local server is needed because `fetch()` may block `data.json` due to CORS issues.
